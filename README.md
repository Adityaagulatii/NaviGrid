📌 Overview 
- Eliminates the need for expensive indoor navigation infrastructure \
- No BLE beacons, no Wi-Fi triangulation systems, no 3D building scans \
- Users take a photo of a floorplan and annotate the rooms they want to navigate between \
- Uses Computer Vision and OCR to understand the layout \
- Determines current location, calculates an optimal route, and delivers turn-by-turn directions \
- Navigating any new indoor space is as simple as snapping a photo 


⚙️ How It Works \
📸 Step 1 — Capture
        Take a photo of the building's floorplan

✏️ Step 2 — Annotate
        Mark the rooms or points you want to navigate between

🧠 Step 3 — Parse
        NaviGrid processes the floorplan using Computer Vision and OCR

🕸️ Step 4 — Build Graph
        A routing graph is constructed from annotated nodes and edges

🧭 Step 5 — Navigate
        Turn-by-turn directions guide you to your destination

🎯 Use Cases \
🎓 Campus Navigation — Help new students find classrooms, offices, and facilities \
♿ Accessibility — Empower blind and visually impaired individuals to navigate independently 
🤖 Robotics — Provide autonomous systems with a lightweight indoor mapping solution \
🚁 Drone Delivery — Enable path planning for indoor drone navigation systems \
